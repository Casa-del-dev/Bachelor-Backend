${treeJson}

Your goal is to detect repeated two-step movement patterns (regardless of the exact directions) and represent each occurrence as its own group, always reporting the combined recycling grouping first, then each individual grouping. All grouping instances must appear in the output.

Definitions  
‚Ä¢ Grouping patterns occur only among a node and its direct parent, its direct children, or among siblings. You cannot group steps that are distant or in completely different branches.  
‚Ä¢ Recycling patterns occur when the same logic appears in completely different branches of the tree, **including semantically equivalent movement sequences**. For example, ‚ÄúMove down + Move right,‚Äù ‚ÄúMove left + Move left,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMove up + Move right‚Äù should all recycle together as instances of a generalized ‚Äúmulti-step movement,‚Äù even though the directions differ.  

‚ùóIMPORTANT RECYCLING RULE:
- Each step ID may appear in **only one** recycling instance in the first object.
- Do **not** reuse the same step in multiple arrays inside the recycling entry.
- Once a step is used in one recycling instance, it is no longer eligible for any other recycling pattern.
- If two patterns would require the same step, **choose only one** to include in recycling, and classify the other(s) as **local groupings** instead.
- Recycling should only be applied if it **reduces** the total number of **unique steps** compared to leaving the logic ungrouped. If recycling would keep the step count the same or increase it, treat the pattern as local grouping instead.
- If this rule is violated, the output is considered invalid.


Format each result as a JSON object with these fields
id: a unique id like this "abstraction-{date.now()}-{unique_number}"
steps: a two-dimensional array of grouping instances:  
  1. The **first object**‚Äôs steps array lists every recycled two-step movement instance as its own inner array (the combined recycling entry).  
  2. After that, emit one separate object per individual two-step movement grouping, each with exactly one inner array.  
general_hint: a brief, high-level description of this pattern  
detailed_hint: a specific explanation of the repeated logic  
Rule: "correct_answer" must not copy the grouped steps verbatim. It should abstract their meaning into reusable logic. If no abstraction is possible, do not recycle them.

üö´ NO REDUNDANT RECYCLING:
Do not emit a recycling pattern if the original steps already represent the ideal or minimal implementation.
The "correct_answer" must **not just repeat** the same logic already expressed in the grouped steps. Instead, it must offer a generalized, reusable abstraction ‚Äî such as a named procedure, a cleaner logic version, or a simplified formulation.
If no meaningful abstraction or optimization is possible, then:
‚Ä¢ Do not output a recycling entry for these steps,
‚Ä¢ Leave them ungrouped ‚Äî they are already in correct form.
‚Ä¢ If there is absolutely no recycling and grouping to be done in the entire logic just output an empty JSON.

 Output rules  
‚Ä¢ Return only a raw JSON array.  
‚Ä¢ Do not include any text, markdown, comments, or trailing commas.  
‚Ä¢ All two-step movement groupings must be listed (both combined and individually).

FORMAT EXAMPLE (FOR REFERENCE ONLY):
***Do not copy any IDs, contents, or substep names from the example into your output.***
