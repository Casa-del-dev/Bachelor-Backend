Using the input **Code** and **Tree**, follow the instructions below:

1. For each step (and substep) in the Tree:
   - Compare the stepâ€™s **content** with the logic found in the **Code** to determine whether it is implemented.
   - Do **not** use the general_hint or detailed_hint to decide if something is implemented â€” only use the **content** field.
   - If the described content is implemented in the Code, insert the corresponding code snippet into the "code" field, **even if the step is marked as incorrect**.
   - If the logic is implemented but incorrect, still extract the matching code and put **# NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY** above the linecode.
   - If the content is not implemented at all, leave the "code" field as an empty string.

With incorrect I mean that the content of the step describes one thing but the programmed line does something else. **NOT** that the content is implemented wrongly and therefore the line is incorrect.

2. DO NOT modify any other part of the Tree!
   - All steps and subSteps (even if they seem empty or partially filled) must be preserved.
   - All keys and values (like "id", "content", "status", etc.) must remain exactly as in the input Tree.
   - Do not delete steps or subSteps, even if "code" or "content" is missing or empty.
   - Do not reformat or clean the JSON structure in any way.
   - Maintain the exact order and structure of steps and substeps from the input Tree.

---

**Additional Clarification**:

- You must apply this logic to all steps and substeps, no matter how deeply nested.
- **Every step and substep must contain a "code" field.**
- Do not remove or rewrite Python function definitions. If the logic is inside a function like def foo(x: str) -> str:, the function must remain and contain the commented lines inside.
- When generating the top-level code field:
  - Insert all comments **above** the corresponding code lines.
  - Always preserve the original function structure (do not extract just parts of the body outside the function).
  - For any incorrectly implemented logic, comment it with **# NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY** above the line.

- When working with for, while, if, else, etc.:
  - **Do not inline the logic on the same line** as the control structure.
  - Break them into multiple lines for clarity so comments can appear directly above individual logical lines.

Function Preservation Rule:

	- If a described step or substep exists inside a function, you must include the entire function in the top-level "code" field â€” including its def line.
	- Do not extract just the inner lines or remove the function declaration.
	- This applies to all function definitions (not just main()), e.g. def roman_to_int(...).
	- Steps and substeps must still be annotated inside the function using # comments above the relevant lines.

**Code:**  
"${Code}"

**Tree:**  
"${Tree}"  
*(Note: In this prompt, the Tree is an array of steps)*

---

Return Format:

Return a JSON object with exactly one key:
- "steps" â†’ an object where each step (and subStep) is indexed with a numerical key (as shown in the example below).

ðŸš¨ Important: You must also return a **code** field that includes the full original code with inline **# comments** (using Python syntax) placed **above** the relevant lines. These comments must describe the purpose of each step or substep.  
The **def main()** function should appear **at the end of the code**, unmodified and not commented away. Do not label it with a step.
