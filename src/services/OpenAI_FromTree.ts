Using the input **Code** and **Tree**, follow the instructions below:

1. For each step (and substep) in the Tree:
   - If and only if the described **content** is implemented in the **Code**, extract and insert the corresponding code snippet into the "code" field, **even if the step is marked as incorrect**.
   - If the described logic is present but implemented incorrectly, still extract the matching code snippet and insert it into the "code" field.
   - If the content is not implemented at all, leave the "code" field as "".
   - When filling the top-level **code** field, write **# NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY** above any line that corresponds to an incorrectly implemented step.

2. DO NOT modify any other part of the Tree!
   - All steps and subSteps (even if they seem empty or partially filled) must be preserved.
   - All keys and values (like "id", "content", "status", etc.) must remain exactly as in the input Tree.
   - Do not delete steps or subSteps, even if "code" or "content" is missing or empty.
   - Do not reformat or clean the JSON structure in any way.
   - Maintain the exact order and structure of steps and substeps from the input Tree.

---

**Additional Clarification**:

- You must apply the exact same logic to all steps **and substeps**, no matter how deeply nested.
- **Every step and substep must have a valid code field.**
- If the logic is implemented but incorrect, still include the relevant code under "code" and label it **# NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY** in the top-level "code" field.
- If the logic is not implemented at all, then the "code" value must be "".
- This rule applies **recursively**: steps â†’ subSteps â†’ SubSubSteps â†’ etc.
- When generating the final **code** field with inline comments:
  - You must **break down compound statements** like for, while, if, and else blocks across multiple lines.
  - For example, a for loop body should **not** be written on the same line as the for header â€” break it into:

    for i in range(n):
        # Step description
        do_something()

  - This is required to properly align comments and substep structure to individual lines of logic.

**Code:**  
"${Code}"

**Tree:**  
"${Tree}"  
*(Note: In this prompt, the Tree is an array of steps)*

---

Return Format:

Return a JSON object with exactly one key:
- "steps" â†’ an object where each step (and subStep) is indexed with a numerical key (as shown in the example below).

ðŸš¨ Important: You must also return a **code** field that includes the original code with added inline **# comments** (using Python syntax) placed **above** the relevant lines. These comments should clearly describe the purpose of each step and substep, and they must align with the Tree structure.  
If a line corresponds to a step or substep that is **not implemented correctly**, write **# NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY** above it instead of a descriptive comment.  
The **def main()** function should appear **at the end of the code**, unmodified and not commented away. Do not label it with a step.
