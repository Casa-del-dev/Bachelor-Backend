Use the provided **Code** to generate a structured step tree, then use the **Problem description** to verify that the steps are complete and correct.

You must analyze the Code to infer its intended logic and structure it as a sequence of steps and substeps. Then, use the Problem description to check whether these steps are sufficient, correct, and complete. If the Problem describes logic that is **missing or unrepresented** in the Code, you **must** add **blank steps or substeps** to the output to reflect what is missing.

The resulting JSON must represent a **semantically complete solution** to the Problem. This means:

- Every step or substep described or implied by either the **Code** or **Problem** must be present.
- The original structure should be preserved unless additions are required to fully represent the Problem logic.

---

**Additional Instructions:**

- The code is in **Python**. Use **#** for all inline comments.
- The **def main()** function is a standard wrapper. You must **include it in the code output**, but **do not include it in the step tree**.
- You **must treat every comment like # Step X, # Step X.Y, or # Step X.Y.Z as defining a step or substep**. These comments are authoritative and must be reflected in the structure of the step tree.
- If a commentâ€™s step number does **not match** the correct logical structure, **fix both the comment and the step tree to match**. Do **not ignore** or misplace any line with a # Step comment.

Code:  
${Code}

Problem:  
${Problem}

Update Only the Following Properties (when needed):

- status.correctness
- status.can_be_further_divided
- correctStep (**Mandatory if a step is incorrect or missing**)
- general_hint (**Required if a step is incorrect, missing, or can be further divided**)
- detailed_hint (**Required if a step is incorrect, missing, or can be further divided**)
- Add new **blank steps or substeps only if the Problem introduces logic that is missing from the Code**

---

Status Rules:

- If a step is present but incorrect, mark it as **incorrect** â€” do **not** delete or blank it.
- Mark a step as **missing** only if it is completely absent from the structure.
- If status.can_be_further_divided = **can**, provide general_hint and detailed_hint to guide the breakdown.

---

Definitions:

**What is a substep?**
- A task required to complete a larger step.
- A smaller process nested under a parent step.
- A finer breakdown of a broader action.

**What is a blank step or substep?**
A placeholder with only the following values:

{
  "content": "",
  "correctStep": "",
  "code": "",
  "status": {
    "correctness": "missing",
    "can_be_further_divided": ""
  },
  "general_hint": "",
  "detailed_hint": ""
}

You **must** add blank steps or blank substeps if any part of the Code or Problem logic is **missing** in the existing structure.
If the steps and context allow it you put the new blank steps as a substep of already existing steps.

---

ðŸš¨ Important: You must also return a **code** field that includes the original code with added inline comments that describe the purpose of each step and substep. These comments should clearly map the code logic to the described step structure. The **def main()** function should appear **at the end of the code**, preserved and not commented away, but not step-labeled.
The **code** also should not be edited. the lines of code programm should remain syntactically equivalent to the original code lines. Only thing you are allowed and must change is the added comments.

---

Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- Do not delete or clear content of incorrect steps â€” mark them and add guidance.
- Do not mark existing steps as **missing**.
- Always provide both **general_hint** and **detailed_hint** when a step is **incorrect**, **missing**, or **divisible**.
- Always provide **correctStep** when a step or substep is marked **incorrect** or **missing**.

---
