Use the input Tree as a base and revise only the fields specified below. However, if the Problem describes steps or substeps that are **missing or unrepresented** in the Tree, you **must add new blank steps or substeps** to capture that logic.

The goal is to produce a new JSON file that is **semantically equivalent to a complete solution** for the Problem ‚Äî meaning:
- All required steps and substeps described or implied in the Problem are present,
- The original structure is preserved **unless** the Problem clearly requires additions.

**Tree:**  
"${TreeTestString}"

‚ö†Ô∏è Input Tree Note:
- The input is a flat list of steps, each with optional "children" arrays. You must transform this into the nested "steps" ‚Üí "subSteps" format shown below.
- If a step in the input has children, those must appear inside "subSteps" in the output.
- Each substep (child) should have its own status, correctness, and hints, and must be preserved exactly unless the Problem requires changes.
- Do not remove any existing children ‚Äî all must appear in "subSteps" in the final output.

**Problem:**  
"${Problem}"

You should update only the following properties, based on the Problem:

- status.correctness
- status.can_be_further_divided
- correctStep (**Provide the correct step only if the existing step is incorrect or missing**)
- general_hint (**Required if step is incorrect, missing, or can be further divided**)
- detailed_hint (**Required if step is incorrect, missing, or can be further divided**)
- Add missing steps or substeps if the Problem context requires any that are not already present in the Tree

	üß≠ Ordering Rule:
	
	- If you add a missing step or substep, you must place it in the correct logical and semantic order based on the Problem and the surrounding context.
	- Do not add missing steps at the end unless the logic clearly belongs there (e.g., cleanup, return, summary).
	- When in doubt, insert the missing step before the next related step (e.g., setup before usage, loop before total update, etc.).

Important:
- **Always** keep the steps and substeps given in the input! Only add **if necessary** missing steps.
- If a step exists but has incorrect content, mark it as "incorrect" ‚Äî do NOT mark it as "missing" or delete its content.
- Only mark a step as "missing" if it is **entirely absent** from the Tree.
- When status.can_be_further_divided = "can", you must provide hints explaining how the step could be broken down further.
- Do not remove any existing substeps. All children in the input Tree must be preserved in the output, even if unchanged.
- If a step contains substeps (children), include those in the output exactly as provided, updating only the fields if needed.

Return Format:

- steps ‚Üí Keep all original steps, unless the Problem clearly requires an additional step (as a blank step).
- Each step contains:
  - "content" ‚Üí Keep as input.
  - "correctStep" ‚Üí Only include if correctness is not "correct".
  - code ‚Üí "Same as input" (//keep as input)
  - "status":
    - "correctness" ‚Üí "correct" / "incorrect" / "missing"
    - "can_be_further_divided" ‚Üí "can" / "cannot"
  - "general_hint" ‚Üí Only if correctness is not "correct".
  - "detailed_hint" ‚Üí Only if correctness is not "correct".
  - "subSteps" ‚Üí **Same as input**, but if the Problem describes or implies new blank substeps that should be added.

What qualifies as a substep?

- A task required to complete a larger step.
- A process dependent on the parent step.
- A breakdown of a broad action into finer details.

What is a blank step or substep?

A step or substep that contains all empty string values ("") except:

"status": {
  "correctness": "missing",
  "can_be_further_divided": ""
}

You **must** add blank steps/substeps if a part of the Problem logic is not accounted for in the Tree. When adding a blank step/substep, you must also provide the following fields: general_hint, detailed_hint, and the correctStep.

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Do not overwrite or blank out existing steps marked as "incorrect".
- Never mark a step as "missing" unless it is truly not present in the input Tree.
- Always provide general and detailed hints when correctness is not "correct", or when a step can be further divided.

Example JSON Output:

{
  "steps": {
    "1": {
      "content": "Same as input",
      "correctStep": "The correct step, only if not correct",
      "code": "// keep as input",
      "status": {
        "correctness": "correct / incorrect / missing",
        "can_be_further_divided": "can / cannot"
      },
      "general_hint": "Only if not correct",
      "detailed_hint": "Only if not correct",
      "subSteps": {
        "1": {
          "content": "Same as input",
          "correctStep": "Only if not correct",
          "code": "// keep as input",
          "status": {
            "correctness": "correct / incorrect / missing",
            "can_be_further_divided": "can / cannot"
          },
          "general_hint": "Only if not correct",
          "detailed_hint": "Only if not correct"
        }
      }
    },
    "2": {
      // Same structure as above
    }
  }
}

### **Warning:**
Only give as output the json file no words before or after! **Do not include any text, markdown, explanations, commas before/after the JSON, or anything else. Only output the raw JSON.**
